# fastai_ml_examples
My attempt to convert the fast.ai (v0.7) example notebooks to v1.0

## About
The [recently launched fast.ai ML course](http://www.fast.ai/2018/09/26/ml-launch/) is still based on the (now) legacy version 0.7 of fast.ai. To familiarize myself with the new ways of doing business with [fast.ai v1.0](http://docs.fast.ai) I try to replicate the provided course examples in the new API.  
The examples are not 100% copies of the original setups as I swap the data sources occasionally to spice things up a bit.
